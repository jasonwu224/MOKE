Thorlabs HNL100L Helium Neon Laser 632.8 nm 10 mW (mounted facing left)
←
Reflector mounted diagonally (reflects left facing laser down)
↓
Thorlabs SCFW6 16 mm cage mount (with what I assume is an ND filter)
↓
Magnifying biconvex lens (focuses laser)
↓
Rotating diffuser disk (scatters the laser beam to randomize wavefront and eliminate speckle, EXTREMELY important for camera imaging)
↓
10x objective lens (focuses light into fiber optic cable)

Thorlabs M76L02 Multimode Hybrid Fiber Optic Patch Cable 400 um 0.39 NA
←
Speaker coupled to fiber optic cable with tape (For dithering, helps with image noise)
→
10x objective lens (collimates light, ie making the beams spread out but parallel)

Thorlabs LPVISC050-MP2 12.5 mm diameter Linear Polarizer 510-800 nm (T-axis aligned horizontally for p-polarization)
↗
Thorlabs LB1471-A-ML biconvex lens f=50mm bbar coating 350-700 nm (focuses collimated and polarized beam onto sample)
↗
Sample (Patterned 60 nm CoFeB or 1200 nm CoZrNb) between two longitudinally-oriented electromagnets
Electromagnets can accept a maximum of 0.7 A current provided 35 V from a DC supply
Near the sample, a gaussmeter was used to calibrate voltage to gauss (gauss = 1.85*volts - 1.20)
